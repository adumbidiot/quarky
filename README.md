## Description
Heyo, it's your boi Nate D the hip hop star. you may know me by my alias: adumbidiot. I present to you a life changing discord bot known as "Quarky". 
Written in Rust, nobody really understands if it is some or none or maybe even a sandwich.
Quarky is a revolutionary new take on the classic web scraping, robotics reminding, announcing, ping pong bot. With built in 'listening to hooman noises' activity, everyone will know that quarky is indeed a doggo.
Quarky even makes predictions about Robotics club every monday,tuesday,thursday, and friday.
"Please may i have a quarky? I promise i'll water it, feed it, walk it, and abuse it."-Swim Meat(AIDS)
"Dope"-A much better customer
